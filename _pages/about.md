I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate working on observational cosmology and advised by Prof. Nick Battaglia. 

A major focus of my Ph.D. is developing new statistical estimators and improving methods for extracting the kinematic Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich (kSZ) effect from high-resolution data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Over the past decade or so, the kSZ effect has emerged as a powerful observational tool for inferring the distribution of baryons and the large-scale velocity field. By pairing current/upcoming CMB maps with various large-scale structure (LSS) surveys.
