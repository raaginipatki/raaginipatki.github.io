Broadly, I am interested in the theme of probing fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using various cosmological observables extracted from state-of-the-art data. Earlier in my Ph.D., I improved the modeling of the ‘kSZ2’ estimator to study its cosmological dependence, and proposed a new kSZ bispectrum to forecast how it can tighten constraints on neutrino masses. In my current project, I am exploring a new way to test gravity on the largest scales, by combining the kSZ and CMB lensing via the ‘EG statistic’. 

In the era of precision cosmology, our ability to infer large-scale information is often limited by our understanding of astrophysical uncertainties. Another theme that interests me is leveraging cosmological/other observations to gain insights into such astrophysical topics. For example, the SZ effects are a powerful observational tool to study the distribution, thermodynamics, and dynamics of baryons in the universe. 

I am fortunate to be a member of the Simons Observatory collaboration, which is a ground-based telescope in Chile currently mapping the CMB at an unprecedented level of sensitivity. 

In my last-year undergraduate thesis project, I analyzed Planck and S-PASS data to characterize the spatial complexity of  synchrotron foregrounds in CMB polarization, co-advised by Prof. Carlo Baccigalupi and Dr. Nicoletta Krachmalnicoff at SISSA, Italy and Prof. Tarun Souradeep at IISER Pune.
