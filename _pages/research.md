My research is focused on probing fundamental physics in novel ways using the kinematic Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich (kSZ) effect.

You can find a full list of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fdNcgbAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Patki%2C+Raagini&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50).
